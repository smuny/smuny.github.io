Life is full of split roads. Decisions we make constantly produce a result, whether it's a means to an end or an end to itself. Life is about decisons which often play a preception that we have control over our lives. I strongly believe that we are limited to the control we have in life. The control we do have is how we respond to the uncontrollable life events. We have goals and dreams but sometimes there are alternatives that we need and our calling may be something completely different from what we invisioned. 

So many doors opened and closed whether it was academic opportunities, relationships or career affiliated. Those doors either humbled me or helped me grow as an individual by challenging myself to strive for motivation. The biggest discouragement was when I realized I compared myself to others and not enough with myself and the potential I could obtain. 

What interested me into this program was the influence and the education of others. The idea of this program would have not been possible if I did not have an interest in expanding my education. I did not want to limit myself in the comfort zone of healthcare. I was able to understand that technology is becoming a crucial part of our society and it can benefit all people in tremendous ways. I chose this program because I want to influence and impact people as I have been by those in developing. The passion for delevoping has been evolved and has been contagious. I am very excited to see the doors and opportunity that this program has for me.
